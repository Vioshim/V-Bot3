This is the folder which contains all the Cogs that V-bot uses, these are done in order to answer to discord events, and answering to those. For more information check Discord.py's documentation for more details on the subject.

### **How Cogs work?**

In this project, the cogs are Cog instances which implement a setup method and they all have a `cog.py` which has the class and add method. Each cog is in a folder which may contain sources which are only used by the cog.
