Good day, discord/github user

This is Pokemon Parallel Yonder, a server that was created a year ago, originally intended to be the continuation of an archived RP server but as the project continued we decided to make our own story.

If you're interested in joining, feel feel free to click our link, there's many things our world building has to offer. From participating in missions, to even create them, here all stories are important, by that reason, users can always shape the story by making their own story lines/arcs as the story unfolds. Here we don't have a main plot, we have parallel stories happening at the same time, which is what makes our server get its name.

Currently we have a great amount of users in our community that are the greatest people that a server owner can even ask for, So don't worry over being a moderator in order to do stuff, here any user can give a hand in what they can even if they don't have a role.

Have a great day and can't wait to see the characters that you can design with our bot.
